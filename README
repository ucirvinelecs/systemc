Out-of-Order PDES for SystemC 2.3.1 (RISC v0.6.0)
=================================================

Introduction

Derived from Accellera SystemC 2.3.1, this library enables
Out-of-Order Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (OoO PDES)
for SystemC model simulation on multi- and many-core architectures.
This software provides the simulator component of the
Recoding Infrastructure for SystemC (RISC).

For details, see:

Use this all at your own risk! (Yes, it's a running gag!)

Installation

As an integral part of the RISC software, this OoO PDES library
is installed together with the other RISC components.
Please refer to the RISC installation instructions.

Status

Version 0.6.0.

Limitations

This is an academic proof-of-concept prototype implementation,
not commercial-quality software.
